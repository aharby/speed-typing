MICHAEL
I mean, seriously, Pam. There’s no way
in a million years that a smoking hot
lesbian babe would come up to you and
ask you out on a date. It just wouldn’t
happen. I mean, I’m sure you must be
very attractive to plenty of lesbians
out there, but let’s face facts: they
don’t look like Jennifer Beals, they
look like Rosie O’Donnell.

MICHAEL (cont’d)
That’s why the ‘L Word’ is just a TV
show, and this is real life. And Pam,
for what it’s worth, if you were a
lesbian, you’d be one of the hotter
ones.
PAM
Um, thanks.
As Michael heads for his office, Pam turns to the camera.
Her expression asks, “Did he just say that?”
END TEASER
INT. OFFICE - DAY
It’s business as usual, when the entrance of an extremely
attractive young woman (MARCI) interrupts the office’s
normal placid calm.
She approaches Pam’s desk.
MARCI
Hi, is this the paper place?
PAM
Um, yeah. Dunder Mifflin. May I help
you?
MARCI
Oh, great! I found the right office.
(immediately takes to Pam)
This one time, I accidentally went to
the wrong office, and spent the entire
morning massaging the wrong clients.
PAM
O-kay, and you are…?
MARCI
I’m Marci, your masseuse.
Pam looks at her, puzzled.

MARCI
I’m in the right place, right?
PAM
I…
HOLLY, from Human Resources, steps in.
HOLLY
Of course, Marci. Hi, I’m Holly. We
spoke earlier on the phone.
MARCI
Hi.
They shake hands.
HOLLY
Thanks for coming in.
(beat)
This is Pam, our receptionist. She
always wears the most comfortable
looking sweaters.
PAM
Um, thanks.
HOLLY
I’m sorry, Pam. Didn’t Michael tell you
that Marci was coming today?
PAM
Uh… no. He did not.
HOLLY
I sent him a memo, and he was supposed
to let everyone know about it. Anyway,
Marci’s a masseuse, and she’s going to
be spending the day in the office with
us.
Pam stares at Holly then at Marci, not knowing what to make
of this.
PAM
You’re… going to give us massages?
4
MARCI
Yup. Trained and certified. I even
brought my own chair.
Pan down to reveal the masseuse’s chair.
MICHAEL (O.S.)
Oh my Lord!
He marches over from his cubby.
MICHAEL
Is it bring a supermodel in to work
day, or did you just wander in here on
your own?
HOLLY
Michael, this is Marci, she’s theMICHAEL
Masseuse. I heard.
(extending a hand)
Michael Scott. Regional Manager of
Dunder Mifflin.
They shake hands. Michael holds it longer than necessary.
MARCI
Hi, I’m Marci, the masseuse.
He’s grinning like he’s won the lottery.
MICHAEL
This is quite a surprise.
HOLLY
It wouldn’t have been if you’d read the
memo I sent you.
FLASHBACK:
CLOSE UP. The “memo” she’s referring to has been turned
into a paper airplane, ready to be launched from Michael’s
hand.
5
Pull back to reveal him hiding behind the door to his
office, stifling a laugh.
He launches it in DWIGHT’S direction.
The paper airplane memo flies a few feet and BOINKS Dwight
in the back of the head.
BACK TO PRESENT:
MICHAEL
Oh, yeah, right, that memo. It must
have gotten shuffled somewhere. Or I
got my dates mixed up.
(beat)
Does Corporate know about this?
HOLLY
Corporate okayed it. In fact, they’re
paying Marci to be here.
MICHAEL
Wow. That is awesome!
(turns to Marci)
So you’re just gonna like…
MARCI
Give you a massage.
MICHAEL
Oh, ho.
(he breaks into giggles)
Just like right here in the office?
MARCI
Well, if you have a room where I can
set up, that would be great. And it
would give us some privacy.
This clearly is the wrong thing to say to Michael, who
starts turning red in the face.
HOLLY
You can use the conference room.
6
MARCI
Great.
HOLLY
Right this way.
As Holly escorts Marci over, Michael turns to Pam, grinning
like a Cheshire cat.
MICHAEL
I can’t believe it! This is going to be
great!
The look on Pam’s face tells us she doesn’t agree.
PAM TALKING HEAD
PAM
The last time something like this
happened, it was a girl named Katy who
came by the office to sell handbags.
(beat)
She ended up dating Jim.
(beat)
Not that I’m worried or anything. This
was way before we started going out.
It’s just that I’ve never had a massage
before. I don’t know if Jim’s ever had
one either. In fact, I can’t even
picture someone giving him one… or me
one for that matter.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
Michael watches Marci set up the massage chair.
MICHAEL
You need any help?
